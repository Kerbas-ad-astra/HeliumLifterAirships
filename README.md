##Roadmap

I'm studying KAC and Landertron to figure out how to make blizzy's toolbar optional and to excise the "lead envelope" stuff.  It would also be nice to get a non-magic-number for atmospheric density (i.e. for a generic homeworld, as opposed to Earth and Kerbin specifically), but since those are the primary homeworlds, that takes a back burner.

When I've learned how to make parts with animations, I'll create a set of envelopes that more closely resemble NASA's Venus exploration concepts, such as HAVOC and VISE, but that won't be part of this mod.

##Credits

Helium Lifter Airships is based on HooliganLabs Airships, release 3.0.1b, copyright 2014 HooliganLabs, JewelShisen, and Khatharr.

Many thanks to TriggerAu for Kerbal Alarm Clock (which I used as a guide to make the GUI independent of blizzy's toolbar) and charfa for the Landertron overhaul (which I used as a guide to remove the "lead envelope" business).

Finally, thanks are owed to JewelShisen for giving me a reason to perform my own resurrection of HL Airships.
